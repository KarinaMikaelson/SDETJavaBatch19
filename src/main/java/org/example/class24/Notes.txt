List (Interface): ArrayList( Class) and LinkedList (Class)- have the same methods.
           List Properties:
               1. Insertion order is maintained.(Order)
               2. Duplicates are allowed
               3. Can be converted to any other class (List etc)
           ArrayList:
               Upside:
                    Very fast when accessing the elements.
               Downside:
                    Really slow when we have to add or remove elements.
           LinkedList:
               Upside:
                    Really fast when we have to add or remove the element
               Downside:
                    Very Slow when accessing the elements.
Set (Interface) properties:
               1. They do not allow duplicates.
               2. They don't store the data based on index.

           HashSet (Class):
               Upside:
                      Fast
               Downside
                      Doesn't remember the insertion order.
           LinkedHashSet( Class):
               Upside:
                     It remembers the order.
               Downside:
                     It's a little slower than HashSet.
           TreeSet:
               Upside:
                     It keeps Data sorted.
