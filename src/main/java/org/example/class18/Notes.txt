Java prioritize:
   1. Local Var
   2. Instance Var
   3. Parent Instance Var
Super Keyword:
- Is used to explicitly refer to the instance var from parent class
- It is also used to call the constructor from the parent class

This keyword:
- this keyword - when we want to use instance var

Local var name:
- Java gives prioritize Local var first, then instance var, and then parent instance
- name - when you want tp use  local var

How Inheritance work?:
- When ever we use Inheritance the objects of the parent classes are created first.
- If we don't create any constructor, Java will create default constructor to create this objects.
- When we create our own constructor, then Java is not going to do this, we have to do it ourselves.

Method Overloading:
- Method Overloading allows us to have multiple methods with same name inside a class
Why should we Overload?
- It gives more flexibility to users. Users don't need to memorize a lot of different method names.
