Java programming language:
               1 Is 99,9% Object Oriented
               2. 0.01% is primitive data types - are not objects

Primitive Data Type: [ int, float, char, double]  - these are derived from C, these are not objects, but vars
               1. Classes for Primitive Data type - Wrapper Class

Wrapper Class:
               1. Provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types
                  reference data types contain useful methods can be used with collections (ex.ArrayList)
                  (each Primitive has Wrapper)

                Primitive:           Wrapper:
               ------------         ----------
                boolean              Boolean
                char                 Character
                int                  Integer
                double               Double
                etc.

                2. Autoboxing - the automatic conversion that Java compiler makes between the primitive
                   types and their corresponding object Wrapper class.

                3. Unboxing - is getting a primitive value from objects. the reverse of autoboxing.
                   Automatic conversion of wrapper class to Primitive.
