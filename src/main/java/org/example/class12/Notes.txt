Methods in Java;
- Methods are blocks of codes which contain some java statements.
- Whenever we call method
- reverse method is only available only in StringBuilder (its mutable)


- Palindrome String - A string is said to be palindrome if it remains the same on reading from both ends.
  It means that when you reverse a given string, it should be the same as the original string.


String VS StringBuilder:
- String - Immutable: In Java, a String is an immutable object.
This means that once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed.
Any operation that seems to modify a String actually creates a
new String object with the modified content, leaving the original String unchanged.
- String - saves space, slow

- Mutable: StringBuilder in Java is designed to be mutable.
It allows you to modify the contents of the string without creating new String objects.
The modifications are done in the same memory location, making it more memory-efficient.
- StringBuilder - takes more memory each time i create new object
- Fast


Methods in Java:
Are blocks of code which contain some java statements. Whene call a method, those statements are executed. Methods have nâ‚¬ we use these names to call them.
String Class:
UpSide:
- It is designed to save space.
Downside:
- Its immutable (not changeable) and slow.
StringBuilder:
 UpSide:
- It's Fast and changeable.(mutable)
 Downside:
- Not optimized for space-saving.

Methods have two types:
- void add -only use to execute actions (does not return anything, only performs action)
  void print()
 void - written type, print - method, () - parentheses {} - boundary
