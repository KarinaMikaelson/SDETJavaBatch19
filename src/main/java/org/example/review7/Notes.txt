Methods:
- Are blocks of code which have names, and they contain java code.
- We can call these methods to execute all the code inside them.
Why should we use methods:
- They help us avoid code duplication in multiple classes.
- If we need to run a piece of code again and again in multiple classes, we can
  simply create a method and can reuse it in all the classes.
Types of methods:
1. static method
2. instance methods.
static methods:
- We call these methods by just writing the name of the class.
- They cannot use instance variables.
instance methods:
- Require us to create an object of the class.
