Abstraction;
- is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality(method header) to the user.
- For example sending sms, you just type the text and send the message.
- You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
- Abstraction is the process of separating ideas from their action.

Abstract methods ( header without the body) -
- to enforce  child classes to use it
- if you want to avoid using abstract method in a child class, we should make this class also abstract
