Develop a system to manage different types of employees in a company.
Base class: Employee with fields like name, id, and department, and abstract methods calculateSalary() and reportWork().
SubcLasses: FullTimeEmployee, PartTime&mployee, Intern with specific implementations of calculateSalary() based on their employment type.
For example, FullTimeEmployee might include a fixed salary, whereas PartTimemployee salary might depend on the hours worked.
Tester class: EmployeeManagementTester to showcase calculating salaries and reporting work for different employee types.
