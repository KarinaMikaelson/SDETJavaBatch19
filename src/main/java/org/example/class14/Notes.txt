Types of Variables:
 -  There are three types of variables:
           1. local
           2. Instance
           3. Static/Class Variables

 Local Variables:
       - Those Variables which are created inside a block of code({}) are called - Local Variables
       - Example: all the variables that we create inside loops, if else statements, methods,
         switch statements they are all called as local variables.
       Upside:
          - They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
       Downside:
          -  They can only be accessed inside the block of code where they are created.
       Whe to use:
          - Always try to use Local Variables

 Instanced Variables:
       - Variables created outside of blocks of code, but inside a class are called - Instance Variables
       Upsides:
          - Can be used in all blocks of commands in the class
          Downside:
          - They keep on occupying the memory even if you are done using them.
          -  When should we use instanced variables:
          1) When we want to share a variable with all of the instance methods of a class.
          2) When you are planning to create multiple objects of a class and you know that every object
          is going to have a different value then you can also use instance variables.
 Static/Class Variables:
       - Static variables have the static keyword before them
       Upside:
          -Highest visibility can be accessed inside the class in any block of the
           code can be accessed in static or non-static methods. Can be outside of class if coupled with
           a proper access modifier.
       Downside:
          - They occupy the memory for longest
          - Can hold only one value (only one copy)
         When to use:
         - When we want to share something with all the objects or the information that stays he same for
         all the objects we should store it in static variables.
