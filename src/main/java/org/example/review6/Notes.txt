What is Class?:
- A class in Java is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes.
- It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. For example,
  Student is a class while a particular student named Ravi is an object.

What is Object?:
 - An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities.
 - Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.
 - A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.
 An object consists of :
  - State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
  - Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
  - Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

What is Method?:
- The method in Java or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller.
- A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything.
- Java Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code. \
- A method is like a function i.e. used to expose the behavior of an object.
- It is a set of codes that perform a particular task.
