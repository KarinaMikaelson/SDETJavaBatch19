Maps:
      1. Maps allows us to store two things at a time.
      2. One is called the key
      3. Another is called the value.
      4. We can not convert Map to List directly


    There are three types of Maps:(Not part of the Collection Framework)
          HashMap
          LinkedHashMap
          ThreeMap
