Interface:
    Interfaces are like contracts, they can contain abstract methods and constant variables.
 Not allowed in Interfaces:
    - No body
    - default access modifier for Interface is: - public
    - no other Access Modifiers are allowed
    - Instance var are not allowed
    - No constructors allowed
    - Methods not allowed
    - private and protected keywords not allowed

Allowed:
    - public static final var
    - public static methods are allowed

When we should use Interface?:
    When classes are closely related to each other we should go with ABSTRACT classes as
    we will be able to use inheritance to avoid code repetition,
    and when child classes are not realted to each other then we should go with interfaces.

Encapsulations:
      The main advantage of using of encapsulation is to secure the data from other methods,
      when we make a data private then these data only use within the class, but these data
      not accessible outside the class.
To achieve encapsulation in Java
• Declare the variables of a class as private.
• Provide public setter and getter methods to
modify and view the variables values.
