Break keyword:
- The break keyword is used to break out a for loop, a while loop or a switch block.
- Once the condition is met it stops the Loop even if there are still iterations remaining.
Why should we use Break?:
- If we use break we save a lot of unnecessary processing by terminating the loop once the goal is completed
Continue keyword:
- Continue is used to skip unnecessary calculations.
- If the element meets condition that element is skipped and move to the next element.
Why use Continue?:
- To avoid unnecessary calculations
Note:
- Break and Continue keywords are always written with IF condition inside the Loop.

2D Arrays:
-  2D Arrays is simply multiple one d arrays combined together in the for of rows and columns.
- To pull or store information in a 2D Array we use two indexes: One to specify the row, and another one to
specify the column
