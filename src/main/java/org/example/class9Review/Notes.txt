Arrays:
- Arrays are collections of multiple variables.
These variables have indexes which help us retrieve and stop data inside the array

Why we use Array?
-  When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables is not feasible.

Syntax:

 Approach #1:    Datatype [] ArrayName = new DataType[size];
                 int [] numbers = new int[5];   // if you take data from user


 Approach #2:    DataType [] ArrayName = { element1,element2, element3, element4};
                 int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 45, 50};  // if you already know what to store
