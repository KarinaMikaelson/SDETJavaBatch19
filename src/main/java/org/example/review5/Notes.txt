Nested Loops:
 - A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop
 - We can Nest any loop inside any other loop.
Why should we learn about Nested Loops:
 - WE need Nested loops to go through multiple levels of data, for example, we might want to go
   through the main categories of items, and we might want to go through individual items in each list.
 - We also need Nested loops to process data which have multiple levels like a 2D array or an Excel sheet.
